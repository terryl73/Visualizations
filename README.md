# Visualizations

This folder is examples of data visulizations that I've designed that have been used on the news site for S&P Global Market Intelligence.

1. Bubbles - One of a series of graphs that display the location, percent change and premium change for the four largest auto insurance companies in the US.

2. CA House Map - A map showing projected growth of median housing prices side by side with fire hazard risk.

3. Global Interest Rates - A map displaying interest rates and periodic changes for the 15 largest countries by GDP.

4. Lloyds Scatter - Displays historical average combined ratios versus the change in the ratio in 2018 for each Lloyds syndicate.  The syndicates are placed into two categories where syndicates with a combined ratio over 100% for three consecutive years (purple) are separated from those that did not (green).

5. LTC Heat Map - Displays the loss ratio for long-term care insurance in each state by shade of red and the national percentage of policyholders in each state as a person icon representing 1%.

6. PC Ad Spend - Displays the annual ad spend of the two insurance companies most reliant on advertising. Progressive's annual premium growth is also displayed.
